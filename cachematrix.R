## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## Actually a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the inverse of the matrix
